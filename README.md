# AaravosBot: "How may I serve you?"

AaravosBot is the custom server bot for the [Dragon Prince Discord server](https://discord.gg/Sg8xR7V). 
It is written using the [discordrb](https://github.com/meew0/discordrb) library and 
my [Cluster](https://github.com/410757864530-dead-salmonids/cluster) bot framework.

The functionality of the bot is split across different "crystals", the modules of a bot made with the Cluster framework,
which can be found in the `src/main` folder. 

Note that this code only exists here for sake of being open source; due to all the server-specific code, you cannot host 
your own instances of AaravosBot (unless you have the technical knowledge to modify the build for your own use)!

I may in the future release hostable builds of AaravosBot's individual features, but this is not a priority of mine.

You can find me in the Dragon Prince server, I'm `410,757,864,530 DEAD SALMONIDS#0659`.
